## Introduction

A Gaussian mixture model is a probabilistic model that assumes all the data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters, this can be so useful in clustering.

## Problem Statement

A shop manager wanted to improve the quality of his business so he thought of hiring someone adequate dealing with data, you got the chance to show yourself to him by making a machine learning model that segmante his shop's customers using Mixture model

## Requirements

1. The implementation must respect all the mentioned restrictions.
2. The notebook must be in HTML form.

## Expectations

- The notebook must be well structered.
- We expect to see how you analyzed the data and how you have seen the relationships between features.
