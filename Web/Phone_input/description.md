## Introduction

Telephone numbers are a very commonly collected type of data on the web. When creating any kind of registration or e-commerce site, for example, you will likely need to ask the user for a telephone number, whether for business purposes or for emergency contact purposes. Given how commonly-entered phone numbers are, it's unfortunate that a "one size fits all" solution for validating phone numbers is not practical.

## Problem Statement

Input elements of type tel are used to let the user enter and edit a telephone number. Unlike inputs of type "email" and url, the input value is not automatically validated to a particular format before the form can be submitted, because formats for telephone numbers vary so much around the world.

Fortunately, considering the requirements of our own website and implement an appropriate level of validation ourselves.

## Requirements

- The solution must allow the user to choose the glaf of the country and then validate accordingly.
- We require the implementation of a phone input that takes into consideration the validation of 4 country masks :
  - Algeria
  - Germany
  - Uruguay
  - The united states
- The solution needs to be implemented only using HTML, CSS and JS.
- The use of external libraries is prohibited.

## Expectations

- We expect a working solution that respects the rules mentioned above.

## Notes

- You can find the SVGs for the required countries' flags in the ressources folder.
- The implementation of more countries is a bonus.
